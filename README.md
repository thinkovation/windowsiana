A very simple package that helps when dealing with Windows timezones and mapping them to standard timezones.

I created this package to handle times that were sent back from a web service that were sent with details of the Windows timezone to which they were tied. In order to make the time usable in Go, I created this little package to allow me to convert an inbound Windows time into a propert time.

The list is also inspired by the [Microsoft Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview) and as of 21st of May 2019 is compatible to all [outlookUser supportedTimeZones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/outlookuser-supportedtimezones)
